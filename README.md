This is not an official Dropbox product. Paper logo by [Dropbox](https://medium.com/dropbox-design). <br> 
There are two Dropbox Paper unofficial Mac apps. <br>
- [Dropbox Paper Mac by mituoh](https://github.com/mituoh/Dropbox-Paper-Mac)
- [Paper for Mac by williambout](https://github.com/williambout/paper-for-mac)

So, why I made this? I'm using Paper a lot for writing and Dropbox Paper Mac app by mituoh popped up on Product hunt so I downloaded it, but the icon was made with Dropbox logo and I didn't like that, because there is beautiful original Paper logo out there. Next, I found out that it was made just with this thing called nativefier. I had no idea what it is so I checked it out and it turns out it's a really cool tool where you basically make a native Mac/Windows/Linux app just by entering an url inside a terminal. I installed node.js and nativefier, made new app icon, and voila. 

I'm a design student and I have never used terminal or node.js for anything, so it was a really cool way to figure some things out.
